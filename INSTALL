1. Dependences ===============================

- binutils
- gcc
- glibc
- ncurses
- make
==============================================

2. Installation ==============================

First of all, you've to decompress the tarball
and move into the folder znake-<your_ver>. Run
	
	$ tar -zxvf znake-<your_ver>.tar.gz
	$ cd znake-<your_ver>
	
Now you should check if all dependencies
are satisfied. Run

	$ make check
	
It will run the script check-dep, if something
is wrong, it will echo on the screen, however
the script echoes to check.log file.
Now is time to compile the sources and install
bin files (ad root).

	$ make
	# make install
	
Znake will be installed in /usr/bin.
==============================================

3. Uninstallation ============================

To uninstall znake run
	
	$ make uninstall

==============================================

4. Manual compiling ==========================

You might prefer to manually compile the sources
or you might do it in case of make failure.I'm a
n00b with makefiles :P
The game is very tiny, compiling will be fast
and very simple. Of course, you must have 
installed glibc and ncurses.

To compile it (I presume you are in znake folder
right now):

	$ cd src
	$ gcc -o znake -l ncurses main.c soviet.c

And if you want to install it (as root):

	# cp znake /usr/local/bin/

Or wherever you want to install it.
